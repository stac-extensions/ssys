This document explains the fields of the STAC Solar System (SSYS) Extension to a STAC Item, Catalog, or Collection. 
SSYS covers data sets that represents an individual image, mosaic, or derived raster of a planetary body. Examples 
of SSYS data include sensors with visible, short-wave and mid-wave IR bands (e.g., the THEMIS instrument on Mars 
Odyssey), visible images (e.g. Context Camera (CTX) aboard Mars Global Surveyor), or derived data sets like digital 
elevation models (DEM/DTM).

- Examples:
- [Catalog Example (Europa Galileo SSI Image)](examples/catalog.json)
- [Collection Example (Europa Galileo SSI Image)](examples/collection.json)
- [Item Example (Europa Galileo SSI Image)](examples/item.json)
- [SSYS JSON Schema](json-schema/schema.json)

## Item Properties

| Field Name      | Type        | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ssys:targets    | \[string\]    | Array to hold list of target bodies (e.g. Mars, Moon, Earth) conforming to the [International Virtual Observatory Alliance](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/EPNTAP/20220822/REC-EPNTAP-2.0.html#tth_sEc2.1.3) target name specification. |
| ssys:local_time  | string      | Lexicographically sortable time string (e.g., 01:115:12.343) |
| ssys:target_class | string | The identity of the type of the target as defined by the [International Virtual Observatory Alliance](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/EPNTAP/20220822/REC-EPNTAP-2.0.html#tth_sEc2.1.3) |

### Additional Field Information

#### ssys:targets

the field `ssys:targets` allows to have one or more targets listed within an array of strings. This can 
happen, for example, if several moons are in the same view. As an example, this scene has both of Ganymede
and Jupiter in the same image as taken by the NASA mission Cassini [PIA02862](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02862).

The extension adopts the best practice from the 
[IVOA](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/EPNTAP/20201027/WD-epntap-2.0-20201027.html#tth_sEc2.1.3) standard. 
For almost all targets, the best practice is to use the official designation of the
 target as defined by [IAU](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/)(e.g., from
 their official naming guide available via the previously linked page or
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEXGyancLRtHyPW7u0L_JNi0V8aDuIhv/edit#gid=1358030832)). 
This parameter is case sensitive (mixing lower/upper cases) and all values must use
the standard spelling and case; unusual characters (such as intermediate 
spaces) are allowed, except quotes (preferably changed to _ , which is the 
single-character wildcard in TAP queries). Data providers must be aware that 
services which do not use the IAU designations might not be accessible by the 
clients.

If the target is not an IAU named body, extension users can consider using one of the following:
- The Exoplanet Encyclopedia provides a nearly complete list of currently 
known extrasolar planets: [http://exoplanet.eu/](http://exoplanet.eu/index.php).
- Asteroids: Usage is to use preferably name (if it exists) or principal 
designation.
- Calibration targets: Values can relate to existing names in a given archive (e.g., 
the PSA contains values such as bias, checkout, dark, flatfield, internal sourceâ€¦).

#### ssys:local_time

the field `ssys:local_time` allows for API searchable non-UTC time definitions. The time should be encoded in a 
string that is lexicographically sortable. It is unlikley that this time should be something like the SpacecraftClockCount or another 
entry from the PDS metadata as most metadata files do not include a local (or local solar time). This field exists to support discovery
in a time format that is meaningful to the user. Suggested formats are provided below:

| Body | Time String Format |
| -----| -------------------|
| Mars | `MarsYear:Sol:LocalTime` |

As a fallback one can consider using the Julian date. This has drawbacks though, as the Julian date does not 
account for the day/night cycle in different bodies which is often a factor in selecting data.

#### ssys:target_class

the field `ssys:target_class` identifies the type of the target. Solar System bodies are defined without ambiguity by the couple
target_class and target_name. Values for this class are derived from the 
[International Virtual Observatory Alliance](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/EPNTAP/20220822/REC-EPNTAP-2.0.html#tth_sEc2.1.3) 
target description parameter.

Accepted values are: 
- asteroid
- dwarf_planet
- planet
- satellite
- comet
- exoplanet
- interplanetary_medium
- sample
- sky
- spacecraft
- spacejunk
- star
- calibration

## Contributing

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the
[STAC specification contributing guide](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) Instructions
for running tests are copied here for convenience.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
